They introduce long sequences of moves that must be memorized, without explaining how they were created, and if you want to solve a Rubiks cube again years later, if you have forgotten a single step of one of these sequences, you are up a creek without a paddle unless you have internet access to learn again.</p> <p>No longer&#33; Once you have followed this tutorial, you will permanently be able to solve a rubiks cube. Your solves may be long and require pencil and paper, but they will not require internet access. The trick is, whenever we show specific moves, they will solve a different puzzle than the Rubiks cube- you will then have to work out analogous sequences on the cube. </p> <p>Fundamentally, this blog post is about &quot;How do I construct a sequence of moves which only affects a few pieces on a rubik&#39;s cube?</p> <p>First of all, if you have read other guides on rubiks cubes, you may have two sticky ideas in your head: First, someone may have taught you that &quot;the centers never move.&quot; Nonsense- hold the top and bottom layers fixed, and turn the middle layer&#33; Look- the centers moved. This sort of turn is important to easily solving the cube. It&#39;s a different way of looking at the same problem, but the difference is important. Second, you probably were taught to solve the cube layer by layer. This is one of the <em>fastest</em> ways to solve a cube, but it is not the easiest to invent: it is much easier to solve corners, then edges, and then centers. These are linked: once you see that moving the middle slice is valid, it becomes clear that any middle slice doesn&#39;t affect the corners. Thus, once you have solved the corners, you can freely experiment with 3 middle slice moves without disturbing them. This is much more freedom than the layer by layer approach, where after solving a layer, you only have a single safe move remaining.</p> <p>This is the last time we will mention a cube- remember, solve corners then edges then centers.</p> <p>Trick 1: size of orbits, permutations, and repeated sequences</p> <p>Any sequence of moves on a rubiks cube will permute the edges, </p> <p>Basically, the purpose of an ordinary rubiks cube</p> <div class=page-foot > <div> <a href=https://subdavis.com>subdavis.com </a> <a href=http://forrestli.con>forrestli.com</a> <div class=copyright > &copy; Hastings Greer.
