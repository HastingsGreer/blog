The scripts contain the entry points, and is developed with the mindset of a newbie rushing to get a course project done at 3AM. The library contains all the importable functions and classes, and is developed with the mindset of an open source maintainer polishing their magnum opus.</p> <p>examples: cgi scripts. each page of the webpage is a script, scripts can import common libraries. orchestrator is apache</p> <p>machine learning: each training experiment or inference job is a script, the orchestrator is bash. bash should be your default orchestrator unless you have a very good reason to clarify: bash scripts aren’t the orchestrator- bash is. you shouldn’t be writing permanent scripts there, but you have bash tools to e.g. run all the scripts in a folder with xargs.</p> <p>if you write a toy ray tracer with the SLO design pattern, each scene should be a script.</p> <p>OG gnu-linux: linux is the library, gnu are the scripts</p> <p>Rules of the design pattern: </p> <p>The three rules that define the SLO architecture.</p> <p>First, scripts ABSOLUTELY may not import each other, and library code can&#39;t import scripts. </p> <p>The practical upside of this is that completely deleting any script should not affect the functionality of the project, except that you can’t run the script any more. If you find that this is not the case, ban a broader definition of &quot;import.&quot; </p> <p>In particular, if you ever find a bug in the operation of one script that is caused by a mistake in another script, this also means a broader definition of &quot;import&quot; needs to be banned. Different scripts may not run in the same memory space or communicate via ram. If at all possible, they shouldn’t run at the same time, or at least shouldn’t be able to tell that they are running at the same time. &#40;This is closely connected to REST rules for cgi&#41;</p> <p>Second, Library code should be high quality: linted, formatted, tested, documented. Library code should not have global state. Library code should not contain duplicated code. library code should only have a minimal set of third party dependencies.</p> <p>This is all extremely standard- the benefits of linting, testing, and documenting are all widely known. This rule mainly serves as a counterweight to the 0th rule:</p> <p>Go hog wild in the scripts. Copy and paste code, use global state, add dep</p> <p>minor rules:</p> <p>Your orchestrator should be off the shelf. Options: bash, apache, jupyter.</p> <p>Having a hodgepodge of independent orchestrators for one project is fine, even encouraged. it’s custom interscript-dependencies in the orchestrator that needs stamping out with prejudice. for example, the unit tests for the library are secretly scripts, with e.g. jest as the orchestrator. Jupyter is a common orchestrator, even though it sucks. This is the only project architecture that has a chance of surviving contact with Jupyter enthusiasts.</p> <p>Note that the rules as stated basically ban testing scripts. Feeling the need to write a test for a function in a script is a very strong code smell that that function should be promoted to the library. </p> <p>Scripts may only communicate through persistent storage: cookie, disk or database. limit this communication whenever possible.</p> <p>Scripts must be single file- this is downstream of script code never getting imported. You can have a multi-file executable, but all but one of those files has to go into the library, with the associated higher code quality standards. This is load bearing.</p> <p>Code duplication between scripts is a fundamental part of this workflow, but code duplication within a script, or between libraries, is super banned. By following this principle, you can maintain the following invariant: at any time, you can delete every script except the one you are currently working on. After this action, code duplication is bounded- the worst case scenario is that a piece of code appears twice &#40;once in the library, once in the script&#41;</p> <p>changes in which script is active should be in response to user input. the user may have the option to queue up a sequence of such inputs, or repeat that sequence, via affordances built into the orchestrator.</p> <h1 id=absolutions_of_the_design_pattern ><a href="#absolutions_of_the_design_pattern" class=header-anchor >Absolutions of the design pattern:</a></h1> <p>Most design patterns, have rules, but SLO also has an un-rule&#33;</p> <p>you are permitted to do whatever the hell you want within scripts. you can have global state, you can copy paste code willy nilly between scripts, you can add external dependencies to scripts on a moments notice, you can vibe code scripts without even reading the diffs. </p> <p>If one script is important, absolutely clean it up- but you don&#39;t need to clean up the rest of the scripts since they are isolated.</p> <h1 id=the_workflow ><a href="#the_workflow" class=header-anchor >The Workflow</a></h1> <p>typical workflow: copy paste code between scripts as a default action. If you find yourself, to make a change, editting the same code in multiple scripts, instead you should usually move that code to the library. Likewise, script code can&#39;t be unit tested- because it can&#39;t be imported. If you want to unit test a function in a script, move it to the library&#33; If these processes force you to move two versions of the same function to the library, only now is it time to add optional parameters or case-specific control flow. Since this is a rare occurance, you can take the time to do it Carefully, and only to the extent needed. As a new tool to dodge making code with a million arguments, consider writing a TUTORIAL and adding it to the library’s documentation, and going forward copy and paste the code from the tutorial into the script and then modify it to suite, instead of from script to script.</p> <p>Alternatively, instead of adding a parameter to a library function, you can always just copy that function wholesale to the script and then modify it. Without any rules, this practice would trend towards code being copied an infinite number of times. However, with the SLO approach, this can only lead to a piece of code effectively existing in two places at once &#40;once in the library, another time modified in the script. It may exist more times in other scripts, but those copies can&#39;t affect the current script&#41;</p> <p>Library code should be unit tested, scripts should be end-to-end tested via the orchestrator, not by writing scripts that import scripts. &#40;this is a potential </p> <p>SLO also has a target workflow for code deletion&#33; Deleting code is actually super important, but it&#39;s negelected. In SLO, the canonical way to delete library code that needs to go is to copy-paste it to whichever scripts still use it, then remove it from the library. Then, deleting script code is a simple as deleting the script. Typically, deleting scripts wholesale is very common, deleting library code is rare but now doable.</p> <h1 id=tutorial_as_a_first_class_unit_of_code_re-use ><a href="#tutorial_as_a_first_class_unit_of_code_re-use" class=header-anchor >Tutorial as a first class unit of code re-use</a></h1> <p>I want to expand more on the class / function / tutorial triad. in particular, I think that tutorial is the correct way for procedural code to reside in a library, with the most overlooked case being model training.</p> <p>One thing that I suddenly noticed about libraries I love is that they have a Lot of tutorials. </p> <p>the rules of the script / library / orchestrator design pattern are tuned to allow tutorial to exist as a first class unit of code re-use</p> <p>Tutorials are library, not script. They should be written using best practices: look at the tutorials in the numpy documentation for the target vibe. They require high quality tests just like functions or classes in the library. In python, sphinx is a great way to run your tutorials in CI when you build the documentation, making sure they don&#39;t rot.</p> <h1 id=conclusion ><a href="#conclusion" class=header-anchor >Conclusion</a></h1> <p>The SLO architecture is not a panacea&#33; It&#39;s just one option for organizing some kinds of project. Not every code base should be Script / Library / Orchestrator- that would be just as crazy as dogmatically breaking every codebase into microservices, orgranizing every single codebase into Model / View / Controller, or only ever coding in monolithic frameworks like Rails or Unity. </p> <p>The comparison to microservices is, I think, the most illustrative. Microservices are a way to bring the advantages of small team development to projects with hundreds or thousands of developers. The strict SLO approach advocated here is really a way to bring the advantages of programming in large open source libraries, like numpy or eigen, to single developer projects. The vibe is that you set out to do a task, and it turns out to be easy because you find a great external dependency that lets you solve the task in a single file- the only downside is that you have to write the dependency. </p> <p>The size of project where this approach absolutely shines is a semester course project.</p> <h1 id=points_to_integrate ><a href="#points_to_integrate" class=header-anchor >Points to integrate</a></h1> <p>when its time to share publish or polish the project, that’s the time to delete lots of old or irrelevant scripts or even just move them to a folder labelled dead dove&#41;. this is always easy without affecting the remaining code&#33; that’s a major goal of the rules scripts can be moved from folder to folder without affecting whether they compile / work</p> <p>if you’re going to do serialization the same way in multiple scripts, prioritize getting that into the library. this is a special case where copy paste is unusually toxic.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div> <a href=https://subdavis.com>subdavis.com </a> <a href=http://forrestli.com>forrestli.com</a> <div class=copyright > &copy; Hastings Greer.
