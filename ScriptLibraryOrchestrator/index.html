If you find that this is not the case, ban a broader definition of &quot;import.&quot; </p> <p>In particular, if you ever find a bug in the operation of one script that is caused by a mistake in another script, this also means a broader definition of &quot;import&quot; needs to be banned. Different scripts may not run in the same memory space or communicate via ram. If at all possible, they shouldn’t run at the same time, or at least shouldn’t be able to tell that they are running at the same time. &#40;This is closely connected to REST rules for cgi&#41;</p> <p>Second, Library code should be high quality: linted, formatted, tested, documented. Library code should not have global state. Library code should not contain duplicated code. library code should only have a minimal set of third party dependencies.</p> <p>This is all extremely standard- the benefits of linting, testing, and documenting are all widely known. This rule mainly serves as a counterweight to the 0th rule:</p> <p>Go hog wild in the scripts. Copy and paste code, use global state, add dep</p> <p>minor rules:</p> <p>Your orchestrator should be off the shelf. Options: bash, apache, jupyter.</p> <p>Having a hodgepodge of independent orchestrators for one project is fine, even encouraged. it’s custom interscript-dependencies in the orchestrator that needs stamping out with prejudice. for example, the unit tests for the library are secretly scripts, with e.g. jest as the orchestrator. Jupyter is a common orchestrator, even though it sucks. This is the only project architecture that has a chance of surviving contact with Jupyter enthusiasts.</p> <p>Note that the rules as stated basically ban testing scripts. Feeling the need to write a test for a function in a script is a very strong code smell that that function should be promoted to the library. </p> <p>Scripts may only communicate through persistent storage: cookie, disk or database. limit this communication whenever possible.</p> <p>scripts should be single file</p> <p>changes in which script is active should be in response to user input. the user may have the option to queue up a sequence of such inputs, or repeat that sequence, via affordances built into the orchestrator.</p> <p>Absolutions of the design pattern:</p> <p>you are permitted to do whatever the hell you want within scripts. you can have global state, you can copy paste code willy nilly within or between scripts, you can add external dependencies to scripts on a moments notice, you can vibe code scripts without even reading the diffs. </p> <h1 id=the_workflow ><a href="#the_workflow" class=header-anchor >The Workflow</a></h1> <p>typical workflow: copy paste code between scripts as a default action. if same code has been copy pasted three times, lift it into the library or the documentation of the library. if the code fits well into the class or function abstractions, use them&#33; if it doesn’t, don’t force it with a million arguments- instead, write a TUTORIAL and add it to the library’s documentation, and going forward copy and paste the code from the tutorial into the script and then modify it to suite, instead of from script to script.</p> <p>Library code should be unit tested, scripts should be end-to-end tested via the orchestrator, not by writing scripts that import scripts. &#40;this is a potential </p> <h1 id=tutorial_as_a_first_class_unit_of_code_re-use ><a href="#tutorial_as_a_first_class_unit_of_code_re-use" class=header-anchor >Tutorial as a first class unit of code re-use</a></h1> <p>I want to expand more on the class / function / tutorial triad. in particular, I think that tutorial is the correct way for procedural code to reside in a library, with the most overlooked case being model training.</p> <p>One thing that I suddenly noticed about libraries I love is that they have a Lot of tutorials. </p> <p>the rules of the script / library / orchestrator design pattern are tuned to allow tutorial to exist as a first class unit of code re-use</p> <p>Tutorials are library, not script. They require high quality tests just like functions or classes in the library.</p> <p>Testing of scripts is a good idea too but it is permitted to not, or even to let scripts rot.</p> <h1 id=conclusion ><a href="#conclusion" class=header-anchor >Conclusion</a></h1> <p>The SLO architecture is not a panacea&#33; It&#39;s just one option for organizing a project. Not every code base should be Script / Library / Orchestrator- that would be just as crazy as dogmatically breaking every codebase into microservices, orgranizing every single codebase into Model / View / Controller, or only ever coding in monolithic frameworks like Rails or Unity. </p> <p>The comparison to microservices is, I think, the most illustrative. Microservices are a way to bring the advantages of small team development to projects with hundreds or thousands of developers. The strict SLO approach advocated here is really a way to bring the advantages of programming in large open source libraries, like numpy or eigen, to single developer projects. </p> <div class=page-foot > <div> <a href=https://subdavis.com>subdavis.com </a> <a href=http://forrestli.con>forrestli.com</a> <div class=copyright > &copy; Hastings Greer.
