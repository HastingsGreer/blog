You've probably seen tutorials on how to solve a rubiks cube- but did they seem deeply unsatisfying? They introduce long sequences of moves that must be memorized, without explaining how they were created, and if you want to solve a Rubiks cube again years later, if you have forgotten a single step of one of these sequences, you are up a creek without a paddle unless you have internet access to learn again.

No longer! Once you have followed this tutorial, you will permanently be able to solve a rubiks cube.
Your solves may be long and require pencil and paper, but they will not require internet access. The trick is, whenever we show specific moves,
they will solve a different puzzle than the Rubiks cube- you will then have to work out analogous sequences on the cube. 

Fundamentally, this blog post is about "How do I construct a sequence of moves which only affects a few pieces on a rubik's cube?

First of all, if you have read other guides on rubiks cubes, you may have two sticky ideas in your head: First, someone may have taught you that "the centers never move." Nonsense- hold the top and bottom layers
fixed, and turn the middle layer! Look- the centers moved. This sort of turn is important to easily solving the cube. It's a different way of looking at the same problem, but the difference is important.
Second, you probably were taught to solve the cube layer by layer. This is one of the _fastest_ ways to solve a cube, but it is not the easiest to invent: it is much easier to solve corners, then edges, and then centers.
These are linked: once you see that moving the middle slice is valid, it becomes clear that any middle slice doesn't affect the corners. Thus, once you have solved the corners, you can freely experiment with 3 middle slice moves without disturbing them.
This is much more freedom than the layer by layer approach, where after solving a layer, you only have a single safe move remaining.

This is the last time we will mention a cube- remember, solve corners then edges then centers.





Trick 1: size of orbits, permutations, and repeated sequences

Any sequence of moves on a rubiks cube will permute the edges, 




Basically, the purpose of an ordinary rubiks cube
