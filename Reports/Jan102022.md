## New approach for weekly meetings?

I thought it would more useful to put my thoughts into text and LaTeX than into
powerpoint every week, since it will be easier to keep track of and to put in
to publications when I write up my research. For your purposes, is this as good
as a weekly powerpoint?

## Worked on writeup of FMAPICON Rolling Loss


Performance has plateaued on the DAVIS task, although I left it training all
week. I put some effort into explaining why the rolling loss helps, along with
a more general [Writeup](/FeatureMapICON/#attempt_3_rolling_augmentation) of
the augmentation approach to equivariance-- if I can wrangle this into a paper,
then this writing will be useful.
 

## Worked on implementing ICON feature requests

I am struggling with wrangling itk's displacementFieldTransform object to do
what I want: the interface between numpy arrays and itk images with vector
valued pixels is the pain point: it is loose and performs few checks, and so
mistakes cause garbage transforms instead of run-time or compile time errors.

Once I have a correctly initialized itk.displacementFieldTransform then I can use it to [warp an image](https://github.com/HastingsGreer/InverseConsistency/blob/bf488289726e69c70a77ac172f1919e83dc250c9/test/test_itk_integration.py#L34) using a very standard itk idiom.

This then makes [checkerboard visualization](https://itk.org/ITKExamples/src/Filtering/ImageCompare/CombineTwoImagesWithCheckerBoardPattern/Documentation.html) etc trivial.
