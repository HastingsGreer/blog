## ITK wrapping of ICON is done and I'm pretty pleased with it

Two problems were cleared up:
No way to register itkImage<Vector> with python's garbage collector, caused intermittent segfaults.
I have a temporary solution that just permanently leaks the memory, Dzenan at Kitware 
is working on a permanent fix

Also, need to make sure that the numpy array that you are constructing the image with is contiguous: 
otherwise, this hits a bug in itk's ImageViewFromArray and causes further intermittent segfaults
I have a pull request awaiting merger into ITK that fixes this issue.

Overall, using ITK for representing deformable transforms in a portable way has been a pain, but
it is done, and after the pull requests in itk are cleared, it will be much easier for the other 
students in the group: They can just pip install ICON and use 

```
icon_registration.itk_wrapper.create_itk_transform
```

Also, ICON now does inference just fine on CPU: takes about 40 seconds for a single pair. This should
be pleasing to Serena!

## ICON applied to atlas images

[notebook](https://github.com/uncbiag/ICON_atlas/blob/master/atlas_registration.ipynb)

It looks like for images with small affine component, performs well. Difficulty with zoomed knees. 
Potential to use image spacing for improved performance?
