Begin lung training

Preliminary real medical training. We train a 3-Step inverse consistent by construction network on the 1000-image lung dataset. So far it is training faster than GradICON, with no folds. I am using a bending energy regularizer and U-Nets for all three steps. I would also like to explore joint affine and deformable registration for this task. I am using the masked lungs, but am curious about performance on the unmasked lungs- especially if I switch to a total variation regularizer.

Next task: disentangle deformable from affine with weight penalty on deformable?
