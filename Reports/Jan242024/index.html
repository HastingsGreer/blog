We reduced the chances of this by refactoring the code base so that the 2-d and 3-d codes use the same codebase, with a minimum of if-statements guarding dimensionality specific code. This is easier to verify than the previous project of comparing jupyter notebooks for 2-D code and python scripts for 3-D registration. Unfortunately, it has not revealed any discrepancy- the previous notebook-script mess was correct.</p> <p>The second question is what happens in a 3-D triangles and circles situation. We investigated this by training just registering the lung masks, which is a much simpler task. The network was able to align them, and the transformer and displacement predictors shared work like &#91;&#93;</p> <p>The third question is &quot;is the retina registration transformer only able to capture complex transforms because it memorizes the train set?&quot; We evaluate it on a held out test set and it captures the detailed transform, making this unlikely.o</p> <p>Huge breakthrough from lin: turning up the diffusion regularization in the split regularizer replicates the problem in 2-d. Turning down the diffusion regularization has no effect in 2d, other than slightly slower initialization &#40;stays scrambled eggs longer&#41;. Trying now in 3d </p> <p>&#40;figure of 2d result with over regularization&#41;</p> <p>&#40;figure of 2d result with under-regularizatioon&#41;</p> <p>In 3d, turning down the diffusion regularization causes a moderate improvement in similarity, and a &#91;inser result of decomposing 3d transform&#93;</p> <a href=/Reports/>Back to Reports</a> <div class=page-foot > <div> <a href=https://subdavis.com>subdavis.com </a> <a href=http://forrestli.con>forrestli.com</a> <div class=copyright > &copy; Hastings Greer.
