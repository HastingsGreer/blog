## Knee:

GradICON medium resolution model released:
[pull request](https://github.com/uncbiag/ICON/pull/18)

Update icon_registration
pip install icon_registration==0.3.3
and switch to the new model
#model = pretrained_models.OAI_knees_registration_model()
model = pretrained_models.OAI_knees_gradICON_model()
This release runs at half resolution just like the old model, with much fewer folds, better dice, and faster runtime:
[action with results](https://github.com/uncbiag/ICON/runs/5511035049?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:89)

Let me know if you also want the full resolution model: it's not quite ready for release right now because it only runs on gpus with at least 20 GB of vram


## Lung:

Ideas attempted:

Focus registration on lung instead of ribs

- only evaluate loss in lung region of moving image
- only evaluate loss in lung region of fixed image
- only evaluate loss in intersection of lung segmentations
- Zero image intensity outside of lung region
- Clip image intensity to `-1000, 0` before training ✅ 

Combat overfitting

- Warp both fixed and moving image with same linear transform
- Train on longitudinal as well as cross-subject pairs
- Warp both fixed and moving image with different linear transform ✅ 

Best (bad) result so far:

```
mTRE: 9.770269366339061, mTRE_X: 2.2851461818021503, mTRE_Y: 6.378642569335982, mTRE_Z: 5.522105794414662, DICE: 0.9608421929940194
mTRE: 7.972476933755549, mTRE_X: 2.5015854799159594, mTRE_Y: 4.762276590067334, mTRE_Z: 4.4913444717735675, DICE: 0.9781910842486858
```

Ideas not tested yet:

- LNCC
- Bring Lin's architecture forward
- Do highest resolution training
- Do overfit

## Brain

Task for marc: fix permissions on test set?

Training setup:

2 trainings currently in flight. 

Both $\lambda = .05$

Both skull stripped

one at half res, the other progressive starting with quarter res.

[notebook](https://github.com/HastingsGreer/InverseConsistency/blob/brain/notebooks/brain.ipynb)

Only visual results so far- evaluate with me?

TODO:

- Evaluate on MindBoggle101 
- Evaluate on LPBA40
- Just do the quicksilver evaluation


# ICON library tutorial

Working on an ICON library tutorial [here](/ICON_SVF_tutorial)

# Transformer compatible with GradICON loss?

Not as far as I can tell

# Theory TODO

- Hessian of loss
- 1-D experiment
- fewer or more samples
- ICON without gradicon, but with loss barrier around $|J| = 0$
- optimization without network
