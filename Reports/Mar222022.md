## Lung:

Ideas attempted:

Focus registration on lung instead of ribs

- only evaluate loss in lung region of moving image
- only evaluate loss in lung region of fixed image
- only evaluate loss in intersection of lung segmentations
- Zero image intensity outside of lung region
- Clip image intensity to `-1000, 0` before training ✅ 

Combat overfitting

- Warp both fixed and moving image with same linear transform
- Train on longitudinal as well as cross-subject pairs
- Warp both fixed and moving image with different linear transform ✅ 

Best (bad) result so far:

```

```

Ideas not tested yet:

- LNCC
- Bring Lin's architecture forward
- Do highest resolution training

## Brain

Task for marc: fix permissions on test set?

Training setup:

2 trainings currently in flight. 

Both $\lambda = .05$

Both skull stripped

one at half res, the other progressive starting with quarter res.

Only visual results so far- evaluate with me?


# ICON library tutorial

Working on an ICON library tutorial [here](/ICON_SVF_tutorial)

# Transformer compatible with GradICON loss?

Not as far as I can tell
