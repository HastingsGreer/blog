## Todo from Previous Meeting:

 - Read thoroughly this paper that approaches davis:
   [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06265v1.pdf)

 - Finish itk wrapping
 
 - Create figures showing failure modes of 
    - no pixel statistics control
    - mean pixel statistics control
    - rolling pixel statistics control

 - FMAPICON try more powerful network?

## itk vector saga

itkVectorImagePython is distinct from itkImage[Vector]. This is suffering.

## ICON itk wrapping

Approach that doesn't work:

manually create a deformation field that goes straight betweeen images of different spacings, orientations

Approach that is working: 

Use linear transforms to move into and out of the space where the neural network defines Phi
