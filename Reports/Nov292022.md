as loss?

atlas registration

multimodal registration: synthmorph?

train one network on all the data we have- leave one out evaluation- very good learn2reg data limited

Paper: diverse regularizers

Paper: multistep SVF

Paper: inverse consistent by construction

Lipshichtz constant of composition < 1 : P norm 2-> 4

Hack on definition of loss to improve performance by reducing map compositions

Neural field registration

Low resolution glitch- get visuals for marc

transformer backbone?



more equivariance? \Phi(Translation \circ I^A, I^B) ?= Translation ? Phi(I^A, I^B)
