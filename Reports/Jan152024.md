@def title="Monai library and equivariance experiments"

=============


Monai work
----------

It's almost completely done. There is a small discrepancy between the original and MONAI verions of the library when loading models trained with the old version of the library.

Here is a difference image between a warped brain registered with the original library, and a warped brain registered with the monai version:

```

The images range from values 0-1, and the errors are in the range 0.03. The change to the deformation field is subpixel but it should be zero.

In addition, there is also a small discrepancy in lung registration. 

Compared to the original library, the test pair has errors that are larger by approximately a .01 mm. 

TODO the test case for TwoStepConsistent is missing. Also, the ConstrICON models were never formally published and need to be- currently just an anonymous google drive link referenced in a colab notebook I think.






Equivariance Experiments:
------------------------

We aim to try:

 - Weaker 2d feature extraction
 - Try retina using 3d code
 - 3D circles and squares
 - White noise to 2d case

We want to reproduce the effect where the equivariant net only captures the translation, and all deformation is left to the subsequent net.
