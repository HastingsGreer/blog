@def title="apply atlas to dxa alone"

Locations of models for this week:

dxa registration model:


Sections:
DXA atlas

preliminary cross-modal atlas

challenge: high energy - low energy xray registration

plot of cross sections of high energy, low energy.

Proposals: 
Gradient similarity metric
CycleGan
simple translator network
just grab the high energy non-fat xrays




Narrative:

First, try registering and making atlas for dxa images. This is easy, as reported in email. 

[notebook](https://github.com/HastingsGreer/dxa_radiograph/blob/master/wholething.ipynb)

Next, try registering and making atlas for radiographs. This fails, cannot capture vertical motion.

Combine radiograph and dxa datasets, registration goes much better

However, registering low 


TODO: 

dxa atlas + different image + different image warped to dxa atlas with grid + zoom in on cartilage
