beginning of week TODO brainstorm

# Cleanup todo

✓ footsteps needs to log uncommitted file if that's what's being run

footsteps needs to log version of packages (in seperate thread)

merge code in "/media/data/hastings/InverseConsistency/" into master

✓ get OAI pull request merged



compress OAI models by dropping identitymaps

add identitymap stripping code to ICON

ICON 1.0 release

merge biag .vimrc

put augmentation into train.py

# Ambitious todo

genius idea: registration that improves previous result: train by randomy resetting prev result

try segmenting latest kaggle challenge

try registering latest kaggle challenge

99%ICON: ICON but the worst 1% of inverse consistencies aren't penalized

mixture of gaussians ICON:
	interpret ICON as "registration outputs a gaussian at each pixel, ICON loss is log odds of exact inverse consistency. 
	in that framework, rewrite to output a mixture of gaussians instead of a gaussian: perhaps can accurately model tearing?

need a synthetic dataset for tearing.

# Marc request todo

train oai knees with LNCC + augmentation

train lung with lin loss + augmnentation

evaluate latest highres model

put all results into the overleaf

make formal list of experiments for paper -- journal article?

put OAI preprocessing into pretrained models


# ITK deficiencies todo

verify whether itk can be installed on an old version yet?

get itk to not segfault when asked to save a composite transform without []ifying it

get itkDisplacementFieldJacobianFilter wrapped for doubles
